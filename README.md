# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository containst the submission for the assignment for week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course


# Objective

The code combined training dataset and test dataset, and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

# Code

The code combined training dataset and test dataset, and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# New dataset: tidydata.txt

The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.

The code was written based on the instruction of this assignment
